# CollectorsReservesSimulator

Groups Marvel Snap CL's (Collection Levels) into boxes, packs, and cases for ease in mapping. Enter special code "Dr" to see the distribution of cards in DrStrangePhD's collection. Feature under construction: soon you will be able to enter special code "random" to simulate a new random collection opening through case 5 (approx Series 3 completion.)
