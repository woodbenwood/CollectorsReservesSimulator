adding 4 to 1006 in groups of 4

Just as it says above, I wanted to do some math to learn something trivial in my video game Marvel Snap
(Trivial but sooooo interesting today.)

As much an exercise in getting fluent in GitHub as anything, I did the math in PyCharm so as to learn.

I learn!

If you find yourself Reading Me, I hope you learned too.
